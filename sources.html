            <h3>Website Production Process Explanation</h3>

            <p>This website was completed with help from a lot of searching
                through w3schools and stack exchange. All of the buttons were
                based on or more or less directly from w3schools.</p>
            <p>For the colors, I just went to htmlcolorcodes and messed around
                until I got something that looked to be about the color scheme
                that I wanted.</p>
            <p>All of the images are from the main websites of the programs that
                I made webpages for. I had to bit picky in terms of which page
                I got these from so that I would only need to cite one page for
                all of the images per program.</p>

            <h3>Website Sources</h3>
